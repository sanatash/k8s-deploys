On Windows, the process of adding an IP address and hostname mapping to the local DNS resolver
is similar to that on Unix-based systems. Here's how to do it:
1. Open the Start menu and search for "Notepad". Right-click on the "Notepad" app and select "Run as administrator".
2. From the Notepad menu, select "File" and then "Open".
3. In the file open dialog, navigate to the C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc folder.
4. Change the file type from "Text Documents (.txt)" to "All Files (.*)".
5. Select the hosts file and click "Open".
Add a new line to the file in the following format:
<IP address> <hostname>
6. Save the file and close Notepad.
To test the mapping, try pinging the hostname from the command line using the command "ping minikube".

* cheese-secret.yaml gives TLS self-signed certificate which browser doesn't recognize when
receives it from the server, so the connection which will be established finally will be non-secured
